DropSTAR
========

Drop scripts, templates and RPC files anywhere on a system, and start up an HTTP server in front of them to handle requests from Python scripts.

Meant to be used for system administration tasks, and low-traffic web services.  

Security has not been a concern up to this point, so there may be issues there though I dont do anything unusual or fancy to cause issues.
